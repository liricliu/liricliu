I **major in Embedded System Development, also join in some software engineering projects as interest**. I'm not theoretically and systematically good at Algorithms, and now I am fixing my lack in this field.

My most skilled programming language is **C**, with about 6 years' development experience using C. Second skilled language is **C++**, as all of my recent projects are written by C++.(OOP is too delicious! ) I also learned **Java(for Android Development)** and **Assembly Language(usually used in Embedded Development)**.

I'm glad to meet everyone who would like to talk about issues in my field with me. I'm also looking for some cooperators for developments about:

 - **Electronic Devices**
 - **Game**
 - **Website and Client Applications**
 - **Softwares for offices**
 
 To reach me, you can mail to **i@liric.cn**
